<h3>Updating Foundation</h3>

To easily update the foundation components you must first have Ruby, node (nodejs.org), and bower installed.  Simply run the following commands:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

```bash
$ bower install
```

The following command will copy the necessary files over and compile any scss files:

```bash
$ gulp
```

run `bower update` when a new version of Foundation is released.
